Dependency injection for the XP Framework change log
====================================================

## ?.?.? / ????-??-??

* Removed `inject.XPInjector`. Its name is misleading, its implementation
  dependant on whether certain other modules are loaded or not. It should
  be called `LegacyInjector` or somethong. I'll leave this to another place
